Computation in the Clifford group 
---------------------------------

In this section we present effective algorithms for computing
in the complex Clifford group of structure 
:math:`\frac{1}{2} ( 2^{1+2n}_+ \times Z_8 ). \mbox{Sp}_{2n}(2)`
defined in  :cite:`NRS01`. Here a factor :math:`\frac{1}{2}` 
means identification of central subgroups of order :math:`2` 
of the factors of a direct product as in :cite:`Atlas`.

The complex Clifford group  :math:`\mathcal{X}_{n}` has a
unitary complex representation of dimension :math:`2^n` 
which has been studied in the theory of quantum computation,
see e.g. :cite:`AG04`. For calculations in the monster group
it would be sufficient to deal with the subgroup 
:math:`\mathcal{C}_{n}` of :math:`\mathcal{X}_{n}` consisting
of the real matrices of that representation. However, the
extra effort for extending the real to the complex case 
is marginal, and using our algorithms for the complex 
Clifford group might be useful in the theory of quantum 
computation.

Usually, in quantum physics it suffices to calculate in a
unitary group up to a scalar multiple of the unit matrix. 
Therefore we cannot simply cut an paste existing algorithms
for calculating in :math:`\mathcal{X}_{n}` used in quantum
physics. 
We keep the following exposition independent of the theory
of quantum computation, but we do not hide the fact that
the main ideas are strongly influenced by that theory.

We present an algorithm that performs matrix multiplication
in  :math:`\mathcal{X}_{n}` in :math:`O(n)^3` bit operation.
Therefore we store an element of  :math:`\mathcal{X}_{n}` 
in :math:`O(n)^2` bits.  In case  :math:`n=12`
this is considerably more efficient than dealing with
complex :math:`4096 \times 4096` matrices.

We will introduce certain complex-valued functions defined
on a Boolean vector space :math:`\mathbb{F}_2^n` which we 
will call *quadratic mappings*. Such a function has a natural
interpretation as a vector in :math:`\mathbb{C}^{2^n}`.
It will turn out that quadratic mappings are closed under 
tensor products and under tensor contraction. Since matrix
multiplication is just a special case of tensor contraction,
we may consider quadratic mappings on     
:math:`\mathbb{F}_2^n \times \mathbb{F}_2^n` as a monoid
of :math:`2^n \times 2^n` matrices closed under matrix 
multiplication. It turns out that the unitary matrices in
this monoid are just a representation of the Clifford group  
:math:`\mathcal{X}_{n}`.



Quadratic mappings
..................

Let :math:`V = \mathbb{F}_2^n` be a Boolean vector space and 
:math:`\mathbb{T}` be the unit circle in 
the set :math:`\mathbb{C}` of the complex numbers. Then 
:math:`\mathbb{F}_2^n` is an additive and :math:`\mathbb{T}` 
is a multiplicative Abelian group. For any mapping 
:math:`f: V \rightarrow \mathbb{T}` define the mapping 
:math:`\Delta f: V \times V \rightarrow  \mathbb{T}` by

.. math::

   \Delta f(x,y) = f(x+y) \cdot f(x)^{-1} \cdot f(y)^{-1} \cdot f(0) .

A mapping :math:`g: V \rightarrow \mathbb{T}`  is bilinear if 

.. math::

   g(x_1 + x_2, x_3) = g(x_1, x_3) \cdot g(x_2, x_3) ,  \\  
   g(x_1, x_2 + x_3) = g(x_1, x_3) \cdot g(x_1, x_3) .

Then we obviously have :math:`g(x_1,x_2) = \pm 1` and 
:math:`g(0,x_2) = g(x_1,0) = 1`. Thus there is a unique symmetric
bilinear form :math:`\beta(g): V \times V \rightarrow \mathbb{F}_2`
with :math:`g(x_1, x_2) = (-1)^{\beta(g)(x_1, x_2)}`.
A function :math:`q: V \rightarrow \mathbb{T}` is called 
*quadratic* if  :math:`q(0) = 1` and  :math:`\Delta q` is bilinear.
For a quadratic function :math:`q` all functional values of
:math:`q` are fourth roots of unity.   
We write :math:`\beta(q)` for :math:`\beta(\Delta  q)`. Put

.. math::
   R_8 = \{ 2^{e/2} \cdot w \mid e \in \mathbb{Z}, 
   w \in \mathbb{C}, w^8 = 1\} \cup \{0\} \; .

Let :math:`e \in R_8`, let :math:`q: \mathbb{F}_2^m \rightarrow  
\mathbb{T}` be a quadratic function, and let
:math:`a: \mathbb{F}_2^m \rightarrow \mathbb{F}_2^n` 
be an affine mapping. Then we define a function  
:math:`f = f(e, a, q): \mathbb{F}_2^n \rightarrow \mathbb{C}` 
by 

.. math::
   :label: quadratic_mapping

   f(e,a,q)(x) = e \cdot
   \sum_{\{y \in \mathbb{F}_2^m \mid a(y) = x\}} q(y) .  

We call a function :math:`f(e,a,q)` satisfying  
:eq:`quadratic_mapping` a *quadratic mapping*. We call the triple  
:math:`(e, a, q)` a *representation* of the quadratic mapping  
:math:`f(e, a, q)`. Occasionally we also consider quadratic
mappings :math:`f(e, a, q)` where :math:`q` is a scalar multiple 
of a  quadratic function with :math:`q(0) \in R_8`. We sometimes
abbreviate :math:`f(e, a, q)(x)` to :math:`f(x)` if the meaning
of :math:`e, a, q` is clear from the context.

The following lemma is a direct consequence of the definition of
a quadratic mapping.

Lemma 1:

Let :math:`g, g_1: V = \mathbb{F}_2^n \rightarrow \mathbb{C}` be 
quadratic mappings. Then

   * For any affine mapping :math:`a : \mathbb{F}_2^{n'} 
     \rightarrow \mathbb{F}_2^{n}` the composition 
     :math:`g \circ a` given by  :math:`x \mapsto g(a(x))` is 
     a quadratic mapping on :math:`\mathbb{F}_2^{n'}`. 

     Hence the definition of a quadratic mapping on the
     affine space :math:`V` is invariant to translations and
     to basis transformations of :math:`V`.
     
   * The product :math:`g \cdot g_1` of the functions 
     :math:`g` and :math:`g_1`  is a quadratic mapping   
     on :math:`V`.

   * For any  any affine subspace :math:`W` of :math:`V`
     restriction of  :math:`g` to  :math:`W`, 
     and also characteristic function
     :math:`\chi_W : V \rightarrow V` of the subspace  
     :math:`W` is a quadratic mapping.
         
   * For any linear subspace :math:`W` of :math:`V` the 
     function :math:`g^{(W)} : V/W \rightarrow \mathbb{C}`  
     given by :math:`x \mapsto \sum_{y \in W} g(x+y)` is a 
     quadratic  mapping. 



A function :math:`f: \mathbb{F}_2 \rightarrow \mathbb{C}` has a 
natural interpretation as a vector in :math:`\mathbb{C}^2`. 
Similarly, a function 
:math:`g: \mathbb{F}_2^n \rightarrow \mathbb{C}` 
has a natural interpretation as a tensor in the tensor product 
:math:`(\mathbb{C}^2)^{\otimes n}`. If :math:`\mathbb{C}^2` has
basis :math:`(b_0, b_1)` then the tensor corresponding to
:math:`g` has coordinate :math:`g(i_1,\ldots,i_n)` at the basis
vector :math:`b_{i_1} \otimes \ldots \otimes b_{i_n}` of 
:math:`(\mathbb{C}^2)^{\otimes n}`. We call :math:`g` the
*coordinate function* of the tensor. If :math:`g` is a function
:math:`\mathbb{F}_2^n \rightarrow \mathbb{C}` and 
:math:`x_j \in \mathbb{F}_2^{n_j}` holds with  
:math:`\sum_{j=1}^k n_j = n` then we put
:math:`g(x_1,\ldots,x_k)` = :math:`g(x)`, where
:math:`x` is the concatenation of the bit vectors
:math:`x_1, \ldots, x_k`.

A vector (or a tensor) in a space over :math:`\mathbb{F}_2^n` is 
called a *quadratic state vector* (or a quadratic state tensor) if 
its coordinate function is a quadratic mapping. Using Lemma 1 we
can easily show that tensor products and tensor contractions of 
quadratic state vectors are quadratic state vectors. As we shall 
see later, they can easily be computed in practice. 
A matrix is a special kind of a tensor, and matrix multiplication 
is a special case of the contraction of a tensor product. Thus the 
matrix product of two quadratic state matrices is also a quadratic 
state matrix. 




For any affine mapping 
:math:`a: \mathbb{F}_2^m \rightarrow \mathbb{F}_2^n`
there is a unique linear mapping :math:`l(a)` that differs from 
:math:`a` by the constant :math:`a(0)`. We write :math:`\ker a`
for :math:`\ker l(a)`. We call a representation :math:`(e, a, q)`
of a quadratic mapping *injective* if  :math:`\ker a =  0`.
We have:



Lemma 2:

Every quadratic mapping has an injective representation.

Proof

Let 
:math:`e \in R_8, a : \mathbb{F}_2^m \rightarrow \mathbb{F}_2^n`, 
and :math:`q` a quadratic function on  :math:`\mathbb{F}_2^m` such 
that :math:`g = f(e, a, q)` and :math:`m` is minimal. 
Assume :math:`\ker a \neq 0`. Then we construct a tuple 
:math:`(e', a', q'`) with :math:`g = f(e', a', q')`, such that the
domain of  :math:`a'` and of  :math:`q'` is  a proper affine 
subspace of the domain of :math:`a`.


Let :math:`v \in \ker A \setminus  \{0\}` and :math:`W` 
be a subspace of :math:`\mathbb{F}_2^m` with   
:math:`\left<v \right> \oplus W = \mathbb{F}_2^m`. Then for 
:math:`w \in W` we have 
:math:`q(w+v) = q(v) \cdot (-1)^{h(w)} \cdot r`, 
with :math:`h` a linear form on :math:`W` given by
:math:`h(w) = \beta(q)(v, w)` and :math:`r = q(v)/q(0)`
a fourth root of unity. Since :math:`v \in \ker A`, we have

.. math::

   f(e,a,q)(x) = e \cdot
   \sum_{\{y \in W \mid a(y) = x\}} q(y) + q(y + v)  
   = e \cdot
   \sum_{\{y \in W \mid a(y) = x\}} q(y) t(h(y)) \; ,
   
where :math:`t(z) = 1 + r \cdot (-1)^z` for 
:math:`z \in \mathbb{F}_2`. Let :math:`W'` be the 
support of :math:`t \circ h`, i.e.
:math:`W' = \{y \in W \mid t(h(y)) \neq 0\}`. In case 
:math:`W' = \emptyset` we have :math:`f(e,a,q) = 0`.
Otherwise it suffices to show that :math:`W'` is an affine 
subspace of :math:`W`, and that the restriction of
:math:`t \circ h` to :math:`W'` is a quadratic function up to
a scalar multiple in  :math:`R_8`.
 
Since :math:`r` is a fourth root ot unity, :math:`t(0)` and
:math:`t(1)` are in :math:`R_8`. If :math:`h` is zero then 
:math:`t \circ h` is a constant function on :math:`W`. 

If :math:`r` is an imaginary fourth root of unity then
:math:`t(0) \neq 0` and :math:`t(1)/t(0) = \pm \sqrt{-1}`. 
Thus :math:`t` is a quadratic function on :math:`\mathbb{F}_2` 
up to the factor :math:`t(0)`. Since :math:`h` is linear, 
:math:`t \circ h` is also a quadratic function on :math:`W`. 

If :math:`r = \pm 1, h \neq 0`, then the function
:math:`t \circ h` is constant on :math:`W'`, and we have
:math:`W' = \ker h` if :math:`r = 1` and 
:math:`W' = W \setminus  \ker h`  if :math:`r = -1`.

The complex Clifford group :math:`\mathcal{X}_n` is a group which 
is defined in  :cite:`AG04` and :cite:`NRS01`. It has a unitary 
representation in  :math:`(\mathbb{C}^2)^{\otimes n}`.

Lemma 3

The unitary complex quadratic state matrices representing
endomorphisms of the space :math:`\mathbb{C}^{2^n}` make up a 
representation of the complex Clifford group  
:math:`\mathcal{X}_n` .

Sketch Proof

It is easy to see that all generators of :math:`\mathcal{X}_n` 
in  :cite:`NRS01` are unitary complex quadratic 
state matrices. The group  :math:`\mathcal{X}'_n` of such 
matrices is closed under multiplication. It is obviously closed under 
computing the inverse, which is the conjugate transpose for a unitary 
matrix. Thus :math:`\mathcal{X}_n`  is a subgroup of 
:math:`\mathcal{X}'_n` . By Lemma 3 the group :math:`\mathcal{X}'_n` 
is  finite. By Theorem 6.5 in :cite:`NRS01`  all finite supergroups 
of :math:`\mathcal{X}_n` in the unitary group are generated by 
:math:`\mathcal{X}_n` and a scalar multiple of the unit matrix 
by a root of unity. Comparing the scalar multiples of the unit matrix 
in :math:`\mathcal{X}_n` and :math:`\mathcal{X}'_n` 
yields :math:`\mathcal{X}_n` = :math:`\mathcal{X}'_n`.

Background from the theory of quantum computing
...............................................


In the theory of quantum computation a state vector representing the 
state of :math:`n` qubits can be written as a vector in 
:math:`(\mathbb{C}^2)^{\otimes n}`, where the :math:`2^n` basis vectors 
of that space are labelled by the elements of  :math:`\mathbb{F}_2^n`. 
Here the :math:`n` qubits correspond to the :math:`n` factors
:math:`\mathbb{F}_2` of   :math:`\mathbb{F}_2^n`. 
In  :cite:`AG04` the unit vectors which are also  quadratic state 
vectors are called  *stabilizer states*.  By Lemma 2 the product
of a stabilizer state  with a unitary quadratic state matrix is 
a stabilizer state. Thus Lemma 3 implies that the Clifford 
group :math:`\mathcal{X}_n` stabilizes the stabilizer state vectors. 
In the theory of quantum computation this fact is known as the
Gottesman-Knill theorem. 

In :cite:`AG04` there is a fast algorithm for calculating in the
Clifford group   :math:`\mathcal{X}_n`. As usual in quantum theory,
this algorithm ignores scalar factors in the matrix representation
of :math:`\mathcal{X}_n`. This means that we have to create our
own algorithm for computing in  :math:`\mathcal{X}_n`. 




Implementation of quadratic mappings
....................................

Let :math:`g = f(e, a, q): \mathbb{F}_2^n \rightarrow \mathbb{C}` 
with :math:`e \in R_8`, 
:math:`a : \mathbb{F}_2^m \rightarrow \mathbb{F}_2^n` an affine 
mapping, and :math:`q: \mathbb{F}_2^m \rightarrow  \mathbb{T}`. 
We implement the quadratic mapping :math:`g` as a triple 
:math:`(e, A, Q)`. 

Here :math:`A` is an :math:`(m + 1) \times n` bit matrix 
representing :math:`a`, and :math:`Q` is a symmetric 
:math:`(m + 1) \times (m + 1)` bit matrix representing :math:`q`. 
All vector and matrix indices start with :math:`0` as usual in 
the C language. For 
:math:`x = (x_1,\ldots, x_m) \in \mathbb{F}_2^m`, 
:math:`x_0 = 1` and bit matrices :math:`A, Q` as above we put:

.. math::
    a(x) =(x_0,\ldots, x_m)  \cdot A  \quad ,  \quad
    q(x) = \exp \left(\pi \sqrt{-1} /2 \cdot \
    \sum_{j,k = 0}^m Q_{j,k} x_j x_k  \right) \; .

We write :math:`\sqrt{-1}` for the imaginary unit,
and we use the letters :math:`i, j, \ldots` as indices.

The user may consider a quadratic mapping 
:math:`g : \mathbb{F}_2^n \rightarrow \mathbb{C}` as a 
:math:`2^n`-dimensional complex vector, regardless of its
representation. In C or python its is convenient to write
``g[i]`` for the ``i``-th component of such vector ``g``, 
and to assume that the index  
:math:`i = \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} 2^j \cdot i_j`,
:math:`i_j \in \{0,1\}` denotes the bit vector 
:math:`(i_{n-1},...i_0)` in :math:`\mathbb{F}_2^n`.
In accordance with that convention we label the entries of
the  :math:`m+1 \times n` bit matrix  :math:`A` as follows:

.. math::
  
    A = \left( \begin{array}{lcl}
    A_{n-1,0} & \ldots & A_{0,0}  \\
    \vdots   &        & \vdots   \\
    A_{n-1,m} & \ldots & A_{0,m}  
    \end{array} \right) \; .
          
Any affine mapping
:math:`a : \mathbb{F}_2^m \rightarrow \mathbb{F}_2^n` can 
be written as :math:`(x_1,\ldots, x_m)  \mapsto   
(1, x_1,\ldots, x_m)  \cdot A` for a suitable
:math:`(m + 1) \times n` bit matrix :math:`A` as above.   
   
   
Wie label the entries of the symmetric :math:`m+1 \times m+1` 
bit matrix  :math:`Q` as usual. We stress that all bits
:math:`Q_{j,k}, x_j, x_k` in sum in the expression for 
:math:`q(x)` must be interpreted as integers equal to 
:math:`0` or :math:`1` (modulo :math:`4`). 
But since :math:`Q` is a symmetric matrix, it 
suffices to know the off-diagonal entries of :math:`Q` modulo 
:math:`2` if we assume  :math:`Q_{j,k} = Q_{k,j}`. 
Due to the condition :math:`q(0) = 1` we only consider matrices 
:math:`Q` with :math:`Q_{0,0} = 0`. It is easy to check that we
can encode any quadratic function
:math:`q: \mathbb{F}_2^m \rightarrow  \mathbb{T}` as a symmetric
:math:`(m + 1) \times (m + 1)` bit matrix :math:`Q`
(with :math:`Q_{0,0} = 0`) uniquely as above. 

Given :math:`e` and matrices :math:`A, Q` as above, we define 
:math:`f(e,A,Q) = f(e,a,q)`, where :math:`a` and :math:`q` 
are as in the last equation.

We encode a number :math:`e \in R_8 \setminus \{0\}` as an
integer :math:`e'` such that 
:math:`e = \exp(e' \pi \sqrt{-1} / 4) 
\cdot 2^{\lfloor e'/16 \rfloor / 2}`,
with :math:`\lfloor x \rfloor` the greatest integer :math:`\leq x`.
We encode the constant quadratic mapping :math:`0` as a matrix
:math:`A` with zero rows.


Changing the representation of a quadratic mapping
..................................................

The representation :math:`f(e,A,Q)` of a quadratic mapping
:math:`q` is not unique. In this section we define some 
elementary operations :math:`T_{i,j}, X_{i, j}` on a triple 
:math:`(e, a, Q)` that to not change the quadratic mapping
:math:`f(e,A,Q)`. In the next section we will use these 
operations to reduce the representation :math:`f(e,A,Q)`
to a standard form.

Let :math:`(b_1, \ldots, b_m)` be the standard basis of 
:math:`\mathbb{F}_2^m`.
For :math:`1 \leq i, j \leq m, i \neq j`, define the linear 
transformation 
:math:`T_{i,j} : \mathbb{F}_2^m \rightarrow \mathbb{F}_2^m` 
by:

.. math::
   T_{i,j}(b_j) = b_j + b_i \, , \,   T_{i,j}(b_k) = b_k
   \quad \mbox{for} \quad k \neq j \; . 

We also define the (affine) translation 
:math:`T_{0,j} : \mathbb{F}_2^m \rightarrow \mathbb{F}_2^m` by
:math:`T_{0,j}(x) = x + b_j` for all :math:`x \in \mathbb{F}_2^m`. 

Let :math:`q'` be the quadratic function :math:`q \circ T_{i,j}` 
given by :math:`x \mapsto q(T_{i,j}(x))`. Let :math:`Q'` be the
symmetric bit matrix representing :math:`q'`.
Then for :math:`i, j > 0, i \neq j` we have

.. math::
   \begin{array}{rcll}
   Q'_{i,0}  = Q'_{0,i}  & = & Q_{i,0} + Q_{j,0} + Q_{i,j} 
   + Q_{i,i} \cdot Q_{j,j}    \, ,   \\      
   Q'_{i,i} &  = & Q'_{i,i} + Q_{j,j}   \, ,   \\  
   Q'_{i,k} = Q'_{k,i} & = &  Q_{i,k} + Q_{j,k}  &
   \mbox{for} \quad  k > 0, k\neq i  \, ,   \\ 
   Q'_{k,l} & = & Q_{k,l} &
   \mbox{for all other pairs} \quad (k, l) \; .
   \end{array}

The quadratic function 
:math:`q \circ T_{0,j}, \;  j > 0` is equal to :math:`e \cdot q'`
with :math:`e = \exp(\pi \sqrt{-1} \cdot(Q_{0,i} + Q_{i,i}/2))`.
Here  :math:`q'` is the quadratic function represented by the bit
matrix  :math:`Q'` with


.. math::
   \begin{array}{rcll}
   Q'_{0,0} & = & 0   \, ,   \\   
   Q'_{0,k} = Q'_{k,0} &  = &  Q_{0,k} + Q_{j,k}  &
   \mbox{for} \quad  k > 0 \, ,   \\ 
   Q'_{k,l} & = & Q_{k,l} &
   \mbox{for all other pairs} \quad (k, l) \; .
   \end{array}

For an affine mapping
:math:`a: \mathbb{F}_2^m \rightarrow \mathbb{F}_2^n` the mapping 
:math:`a' = a \circ T_{i,j}` with :math:`i \geq 0, j > 0, j \neq i`
is represented by the matrix :math:`A'` given by:

.. math::
   \begin{array}{rcll}
   A'(i, l) & = &  A(i, l) + A(j, l) \, ,   \\ 
   A'(k, l) & = &  A(k, l)  &  \mbox{for} \quad  k \neq j  \; .
   \end{array}


This means that adding row and column :math:`j >0` to row and 
and column :math:`i \geq 0` of a matrix  :math:`Q` representing 
a quadratic function changes that matrix to a matrix :math:`Q'`
representing :math:`Q \circ T_{i,j}`, up to a scalar factor 
(which is a fourth root of unity) and some corrections
required for the entries 
:math:`Q'_{0,j}, Q'_{j,0}` and :math:`Q'_{0,0}` of
:math:`Q'`. Similarly, adding row :math:`j` to row :math:`i` 
of a matrix  :math:`A` representing an affine mapping from 
:math:`\mathbb{F}_2^m` to :math:`\mathbb{F}_2^n` changes
matrix  :math:`A` to a matrix representing the affine mapping
:math:`A \circ T_{i,j}`.
 

We obviously have 
:math:`f(e, A, Q) = f(e, A \circ T_{i,j}, Q \circ T_{i,j})`.
So we may perform a row operation on matrix :math:`A`, and 
also a row and a column operation on matrix `Q` without
changing `f(e, A, Q)`, (up to a few corrections in line and
column :math:`0` of :math:`Q`). 
  
If  :math:`f(e, A, Q)` is in *echelon form*, (as defined in the
following section), then it remains in echelon form after 
applying an operation  :math:`T_{i,j}, i < j`.


For :math:`i, j > 0`  let :math:`X_{i,j}` be the operation on 
the triple :math:`(e, A, Q)` that exchanges rows :math:`i` with 
row :math:`j`  of :math:`A` and :math:`Q`, and also column 
:math:`i` with column :math:`j` of :math:`Q`. The operation
:math:`X_{i,j}` does not change :math:`f(e, A, Q)`.

Reducing the representation of a quadratic mapping
..................................................

We call a representation  :math:`(e, A, Q)`  of a quadratic 
mapping *reduced* if the following conditions hold:

  * :math:`A` has no nonzero rows.

  * Let :math:`A_1` be the matrix obtained from :math:`A` by 
    prepending the column vector :math:`(1,0,\ldots,0)^\top`. 
    Then the leading coefficient of a row of :math:`A_1`
    is always strictly  to the right of the leading coefficient 
    of the row above it.
    
  * Each column containing a leading coefficient of a row
    has  zeros in all its other entries.  
  
Here the *leading coefficient* of a row of matrix :math:`A` is 
the first nonzero entry in that row. We call the  representation
:math:`(e, A, Q)` *echelonized* if only the first two of the
three conditions above are satisfied.

Obviously, a reduced or echelonized representation 
:math:`(e, A, Q)` also injective. It is easy to see that any 
quadratic mapping has a unique reduced representation. 


In this section we present an algorithm for converting a 
representation of a quadratic function to a reduced 
representation. Function ``qstate12_reduce`` in module
``qstate12.c`` implements this algorithm.


A matrix is in *row echelon form* if 

  * All rows consisting of only zeros are at the bottom.
  
  * The leading coefficient of a nonzero row is always strictly 
    to the right of the leading coefficient of the row above it.
    
A matrix  :math:`A` is in *reduced row echelon* form if  it is 
in echelon form, and each column containing a leading coefficient 
of a row has  zeros in all its other entries.  See e.g.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row_echelon_form .


Let :math:`T_{i,j}, X_{i,j}` be as in the last section.
In order to reduce a representation :math:`(e, A, Q)` of a
quadratic mapping :math:`f(e, A, Q)` we apply several 
operations :math:`T_{i,j}, X_{i,j}` on the components 
:math:`e, A, Q`. Neither of these two operations changes 
:math:`f(e, A, Q)`. 

Given :math:`A`, let :math:`A_1 = A_1(A)` be obtained from 
:math:`A` as above. By applying a sequence of operations 
:math:`T_{i,j}`, :math:`X_{i,j}` we may convert :math:`A_1` 
to reduced echelon form. If :math:`A_1` is in reduced
echelon form and contains no zero rows at the bottom then the 
representation :math:`(e, A, Q)` is reduced. Otherwise we use 
the following algorithm repeatedly to remove the zero rows 
from the bottom of :math:`A`.

Let :math:`i` be the index of the last row of :math:`A` and assume
:math:`A_{i,j}=0`  for all :math:`j`.

Let :math:`i'` be the highest index with  :math:`Q_{i,i'}=1`.
If such an :math:`i'` exists then we add row :math:`i'` of 
:math:`A` to all  rows :math:`k` where   :math:`Q_{k,i}=1` holds
and we adjust :math:`Q`. Afterwards we have  :math:`Q_{i',i}=1`
for at most one index  :math:`i'`.



Case 1:  :math:`Q_{i',i}=0` for all :math:`i'`

The we may delete the last row of :math:`A` , adjust :math:`Q`,
and double  :math:`e` without changing :math:`f(e, A, Q)`.


Case 2:  :math:`Q_{0,i}=1` 

Then :math:`f(e, A, Q)` is the constant function :math:`0`.
  
  
Case 3.  :math:`Q_{i',i}=1, 0 < i' < i`

Then we add row :math:`i` of  :math:`A` to all  rows 
:math:`k \notin \{i,i'\}` where   :math:`Q_{k,i'}=1` holds
and we adjust :math:`Q`. Afterwards we have
:math:`Q_{k,i'} = Q_{i',k} = Q_{k,i} = Q_{i,k} = 0` for all
:math:`k \notin \{i,i'\}`,  :math:`Q_{i,i} = 0` , and 
:math:`Q_{i,i'} = Q_{i',i} = 1`. So we may delete rows
:math:`i`  and :math:`i'`  of :math:`A`, adjust  :math:`Q`,
and double :math:`e` without changing :math:`f(e, A, Q)`.


Case 4:  :math:`Q_{i,i}=1`

Then :math:`f(e, A, Q)` is not changed if we delete the last row 
:math:`i` of :math:`A`, adjust :math:`Q`, and multiply :math:`e` 
by :math:`1 + \sqrt{-1}`.


Remark

The algorithm sketched in this subsection yields an alternative
proof of Lemma 2.


Extending a quadratic mapping
.............................


Let :math:`g: \mathbb{F}_2^{n} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}` be a 
quadratic mapping with :math:`g = f(e,A,Q)`, where  :math:`A`
is an :math:`(m+1) \times n`  and :math:`Q` is an 
:math:`(m+1) \times (m+1)` bit matrix. Define 
:math:`g^{(j)}: \mathbb{F}_2^{n+1}\rightarrow \mathbb{C}` by
 
.. math::
   g^{(j)}(x_{n},\ldots, x_j, x_{j-1}, \ldots, x_0) 
   = g(x_{n},\ldots, x_{j+1}, x_{j-1}, \ldots,  x_0)  \; .
   
So  :math:`g^{(j)}` does not depend on bit :math:`j` 
of :math:`x`.
   
Then we have :math:`g^{(j)} = f(e,A',Q')` for matrices 
:math:`A',Q'` defined as follows. :math:`A'` is obtained from 
:math:`A'`  by first appending a zero row at the bottom, and 
then inserting a zero column to the right of bit position 
:math:`j`. Finally, we change the entry at the bottom of the 
inserted column  from :math:`0` to :math:`1`.  :math:`Q'` 
is obtained from :math:`Q'` by appending a zero row at the 
bottom and a zero column at the right. Then we have


.. math::
   f(e,A',Q')(x_{n},\ldots, x_j, x_{j-1}, \ldots, x_0) = 
   f(e,A,Q)(x_{n},\ldots, x_{j+1}, x_{j-1}, \ldots,  x_0) \; ,

as required. Function ``qstate12_extend`` in module 
``qstate12.c`` implements the extension of a quadratic mapping.




Products and tensor products of quadratic mappings
..................................................



Let :math:`g^{(\lambda)}, \lambda = 1, 2`, be arbitrary 
complex-valued functions on :math:`\mathbb{F}_2^{n_\lambda}`.
Let :math:`V_\lambda` be the complex vector space 
:math:`(\mathbb{C}^2)^{\otimes {n_\lambda}}` of dimension
:math:`2^{n_\lambda}`.
Then  :math:`g^{(\lambda)}` has a natural interpretation
as a vector in :math:`V_\lambda`. Here the basis vectors of
:math:`V_\lambda` are labelled by the elements of 
:math:`\mathbb{F}_2^{n_\lambda}`. Any function
:math:`h:\mathbb{F}_2^{n_1 + n_2} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}` can 
be considered as tensor in the space :math:`V_1 \otimes V_2`. 
Then the coordinate of that tensor with respect to the basis 
vector labeled by :math:`b_1 \otimes b_2` , 
:math:`b_\lambda \in \mathbb{F}_2^{n_\lambda}`,
is equal to :math:`h(b_1, b_2)`.




For :math:`\lambda = 1, 2` let  
:math:`g^{(\lambda)} : \mathbb{F}_2^{n_\lambda}
\rightarrow   \mathbb{C}` be as above. For
:math:`c \leq j \leq \min(n_1, n_2)` we define a mapping 
:math:`(g^{(1)} \odot g^{(2)})_{j,c} : 
\mathbb{F}_2^{n_1+n_2-j-c} \rightarrow  \mathbb{C}` by

.. math::
    \left(g^{(1)} \odot g^{(2)}\right)_{j,c} \;(x', x_1, x_2) = 
    \sum_{x \in \mathbb{F}_2^c}
    g^{(1)}(x, x', x_1) \cdot   g^{(2)}(x, x',  x_2) \; , 

where :math:`x' \in \mathbb{F}_2^{j-c},  \; 
x_\lambda \in \mathbb{F}_2^{n_\lambda-j}`. We abbreviate
:math:`(g^{(1)} \odot g^{(2)})_{j,0}` to 
:math:`(g^{(1)} \odot g^{(2)})_{0}`.


If :math:`g^{(1)}` and  :math:`g^{(2)}` are quadratic mappings
then :math:`(g^{(1)} \odot g^{(2)})_n` is a quadratic 
mapping by Lemma 1. Condsidering the corresponding quadratic 
state vectors we see that
:math:`(g^{(1)} \odot g^{(2)})_0` is just the tensor product
:math:`g^{(1)} \otimes g^{(2)}` of  
:math:`g^{(1)}` and :math:`g^{(2)}`. 



The functions :math:`g^{(\lambda)}, \lambda = 1, 2` defined
above may also be considered as  tensors in the spaces
:math:`V_0 \otimes V_\lambda` with
:math:`V_0 = (\mathbb{C}^2)^{ \otimes j}`,
:math:`V_\lambda = (\mathbb{C}^2)^{ \otimes n_\lambda - j}`.
Then 
:math:`g^{(1)} \otimes g^{(2)} \in  V_0 \otimes V_1
\otimes V_0 \otimes V_2`. We assume that :math:`V_0` is equal
to it dual space via the standard Euclidean scalar product.
Then we obtain the contraction of :math:`g^{(1)} \otimes g^{(2)}`
over the two copies of :math:`V_0` as 
:math:`(g^{(1)} \otimes g^{(2)})_{j,j}`. The result has to be 
interpreted as a tensor in the space :math:`V_1 \otimes V_2`.


The tensors :math:`g^{(\lambda)}` in the space 
:math:`V_0 \otimes V^\lambda` given above can also be 
considered as :math:`2^{j} \times 2^{k_\lambda}` matrices
:math:`M_\lambda`, with  :math:`k_\lambda = n_\lambda - j`.
Then the contraction :math:`(g^{(1)} \otimes g^{(2)})_{j,j}`
given above corresponds to the matrix product 
:math:`M_1^\top \cdot M_2`, which is a :math:`k_1 \times k_2`
matrix. 


In the next two sections we present an algorithm for computing
:math:`(g^{(1)} \odot g^{(2)})_{j,c}` for quadratic mappings 
:math:`g^{(1)}, g^{(2)}`. This yields an algorithm for tensor 
contraction and also for matrix multiplication of quadratic 
state matrices. Note that the transposition of a quadratic
state matrix :math:`M` is a rather simple operation that can 
be  achieved by exchanging columns in the :math:`A` part
of a representation   :math:`(e, A, Q)` of :math:`M`.
The functions ``qstate12_product`` and ``qstate12_matmul``
in module ``qmatrix12.c`` implement the operation
:math:`(. \odot .)_{j,c}` and the matrix multiplication.

The operator :math:`(. \odot .)_{j,c}` can be implemented in 
python with the ``numpy`` package. Let ``c1`` and ``c2`` be
one-dimensional  complex ``numpy`` arrays of length 
:math:`2^{n_1}` and :math:`2^{n_2}`  corresponding to the 
vectors :math:`g^{(1)}` and :math:`g^{(2)}`, respectively. 
Then a ``numpy`` array ``c3`` corresponding to the vector  
:math:`(g^{(1)} \otimes g^{(2)})_{j,c}` can be computed as 
follows:

.. code-block:: python

  import numpy as np
  c1a = c1.reshape((2**c, 2**(j-c), -1))
  c2a = c2.reshape((2**c, 2**(j-c), -1)) 
  c3 = np.einsum("cjk,cjl->jkl", c1a, c2a)
  c3 = c3.reshape((-1,))

Without going into details,
we remark that in the  graphical ZX-calculus (which is used for 
describing linear maps between qubits) is an appropriate setup
for 'explaining' the operation :math:`(. \odot .)_{j,c}`,
see  e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX-calculus .


An algorithm for multiplying quadratic mappings
...............................................


TODO: Check documentation fromthis point on!!!

In this section we present an effective algorithm for computing 
the product :math:`g^{(1)} \cdot g^{(2)}` of two 
quadratic mappings  
:math:`g^{(1)}, g^{(2)}:  \mathbb{F}_2^n \rightarrow \mathbb{C}`.
Such an algorithm is a key ingredient for implementing
the operator :math:`(.\odot.)_{j,c}`.
For  :math:`\lambda = 1,2` let 
:math:`(e^{(\lambda)}, A^{(\lambda)}, Q^{(\lambda)})` 
be a reduced representation of :math:`g^{(\lambda)}`.


We will show that for any  :math:`j \leq n` there are 
quadratic mappings :math:`g^{(\lambda,j)} = 
f\big(e^{(\lambda,j)}, A^{(\lambda,j)}, Q^{(\lambda,j)} \big)` 
with 
:math:`g^{(1,j)} \cdot g^{(2,j)}` =
:math:`g^{(1)} \cdot g^{(2)}`, where the first 
:math:`j` columns of :math:`A^{(1,j)}` and :math:`A^{(2,j)}`
are equal, and both, :math:`A^{(1,j)}` and :math:`A^{(2,j)}`,
are in reduced echelon form.
We put  :math:`A^{(\lambda,0)} = A^{(\lambda)}`.



Assume that 
:math:`e^{(\lambda,j-1)}, A^{(\lambda,j-1)}, 
Q^{(\lambda,j-1)}` satisfy the conditions given above.
Then we can compute
:math:`\big(e^{(\lambda,j)}, A^{(\lambda,j)}, Q^{(\lambda,j)}\big)`
from
:math:`\big(e^{(\lambda,j-1)}, A^{(\lambda,j-1)}, 
Q^{(\lambda,j-1)}\big)` as follows:


 Case 1:  Both, :math:`A^{(1,j-1)}` and :math:`A^{(2,j-1)}`,
 have a row with leading coefficient in column  :math:`j`.

 Since :math:`A^{(1,j-1)}` and :math:`A^{(2,j-1)}` are in reduced
 echelon form and the first :math:`j-1` columns of these two
 matrices are equal, we conclude that the first  :math:`j` 
 columns of  :math:`A^{(1,j-1)}` and :math:`A^{(2,j-1)}` are equal.

 So we may put 
 :math:`\big(e^{(\lambda,j)}, A^{(\lambda,j)}, Q^{(\lambda,j)}\big) =
 \big( e^{(\lambda,j-1)}, A^{(\lambda,j-1)}, Q^{(\lambda,j-1)}\big)` 
 for :math:`\lambda  = 1,2`.

 Case 2: Only :math:`A^{(1,j-1)}` has a row with leading 
 coefficient in column  :math:`j`.

 Assume that this row of :math:`A^{(1,j-1)}` has index :math:`i`. 
 We add row :math:`i` to all rows :math:`k` of :math:`A^{(1,j-1)}` 
 where :math:`A^{(1,j-1)}_{k,j} \neq  A^{(2,j-1)}_{k,j}`.
 Therefore we apply the operation :math:`T_{i,k}` defined in 
 section *Changing the representation of a quadratic mapping*.
 So we obtain a representation 
 :math:`f\big(e^{(1,j-1)'}, A^{(1,j-1)'}, Q^{(1,j-1)'}\big)`
 of :math:`g^{(1,j-1)}`, where the first :math:`j` columns
 of :math:`A^{(1,j-1)'}` and :math:`A^{(2,j-1)}` are equal,
 except for the coefficient in row :math:`i`, column :math:`j`.
 
 We obtain  :math:`A^{(1,j)}` from :math:`A^{(1,j-1)'}` by deleting 
 row :math:`i` of  :math:`A^{(1,j-1)'}`, and :math:`Q^{(1,j)}` 
 from :math:`Q^{(1,j-1)'}` by deleting row and column :math:`i`.  
 We put :math:`e^{(1,j)} = e^{(1,j-1)'}`. We put
 :math:`\left(e^{(2,j)},A^{(2,j)},Q^{(2,j)}\right)` =  
 :math:`\left(e^{(2,j-1)},A^{(2,j-1)},Q^{(2,j-1)}\right)`.

 By construction, matrix :math:`A^{(1,j)}`  is in reduced echelon
 from and the first :math:`j` columns of  :math:`A^{(1,j)}` and 
 :math:`A^{(2,j)}` are equal.

 It remains to show that deleting row :math:`i` of matrix 
 :math:`A^{(1,j-1)'}` does not change 
 :math:`g^{(1)} \cdot g^{(2)}`. 

 Let :math:`D^{(\lambda)}` be the submatrix of 
 :math:`A^{(\lambda,j-1)'}` that consists of the first :math:`j`
 columns of :math:`A^{(1,j-1)'}`. For computing 
 :math:`g^{(1)} \cdot g^{(2)}` we only have to consider
 rows of matrix :math:`D^{(1)}` that are linear combinations of 
 rows of matrix :math:`D^{(2)}`, excluding row :math:`0` of both 
 matrices. By construction, :math:`D^{(1)}` and :math:`D^{(2)}` 
 are in reduced echelon form, row :math:`i` of :math:`D^{(1)}` has 
 its leading coefficient in column :math:`j`, and in 
 :math:`D^{(2)}` there is no row with leading coefficient in 
 column :math:`j`. Thus row  :math:`i` of :math:`D^{(1)}`  is
 not a linear combination of the rows of  :math:`D^{(2)}`,
 ignoring row :math:`0` of :math:`D^{(2)}`.

 Case 3: Only :math:`A^{(2,j-1)}` has a row with leading 
 coefficient in column  :math:`j`.

 This case is symmetric to case 2, exchanging the role of
 :math:`A^{(1,j-1)}` and :math:`A^{(2,j-1)}`.

 Case 4:
 Neither :math:`A^{(1,j-1)}` nor  :math:`A^{(2,j-1)}` has a 
 row with leading coefficient in column  :math:`j`.

 Case 4.1: Columns :math:`j` of :math:`A^{(1,j-1)}` and  
 :math:`A^{(2,j-1)}`  are equal.

 Then we may proceed as in case 1.

 Case 4.2: Column :math:`j` of :math:`A^{(1,j-1)}` and  
 :math:`A^{(2,j-1)}` are equal except in row :math:`0`.

 Assume that :math:`x^{(1)}` is in the support of
 :math:`g^{(1,j-1)}`, :math:`x^{(2)}` is in the support of
 :math:`g^{(2,j-1)}`, and that the leftmost :math:`j-1` 
 bits of :math:`x^{(1)}` and :math:`x^{(2)}` are equal.
 Then from the properties of :math:`A^{(1,j-1)}` and 
 :math:`A^{(2,j-1)}` we conclude that :math:`x^{(1)}`
 and :math:`x^{(2)}` must  differ in the bit at position 
 :math:`j`. Thus :math:`g^{(1,j-1)} \cdot g^{(2,j-1)}` 
 is the  constant function :math:`0`,  and we may put 
 :math:`e^{(1,j)}  = e^{(2,j)}  = 0`.

 Case 4.3: There is an :math:`i>0` with 
 :math:`A^{(1,j-1)}_{i,j}  \neq A^{(2,j-1)}_{i,j}`.  

 Let :math:`i` be the highest row index such that
 :math:`A^{(1,j-1)}_{i,j}  \neq A^{(2,j-1)}_{i,j}` holds.

 For :math:`\lambda = 1,2` we add row :math:`i` to all rows 
 :math:`k` of :math:`A^{(\lambda,j-1)}` where 
 :math:`A^{(1,j-1)}_{k,j} \neq  A^{(2,j-1)}_{k,j}` by
 applying operations :math:`T_{i,k}`.
 
 So we obtain a representation 
 :math:`f\big(e^{(1,j-1)'}, A^{(1,j-1)'}, Q^{(1,j-1)'}\big)`
 of :math:`g^{(1,j-1)}`, where the first :math:`j` columns
 of :math:`A^{(1,j-1)'}` and :math:`A^{(2,j-1)}` are equal,
 except for the coefficient in row :math:`i`, column :math:`j`.

 For :math:`j = 1, 2` we obtain   :math:`A^{(\lambda,j)}` from 
 :math:`A^{(\lambda,j-1)'}`  by deleting row :math:`i` of  
 :math:`A^{(\lambda,j-1)'}`. We obtain  :math:`Q^{(\lambda,j)}` 
 from :math:`Q^{(\lambda,j-1)'}` by deleting  row and column 
 :math:`i`.  We put  :math:`e^{(\lambda,j)} = e^{(\lambda,j-1)'}`.

 A similar argument as in case 2 shows that matrices 
 :math:`A^{(1,j)}` and  :math:`A^{(2,j)}` are as required and 
 that deleting row :math:`i` from 
 :math:`A^{(1,j-1')}` and  :math:`A^{(2,j-1')}` does not change
 :math:`g^{(1)} \cdot g^{(2)}`.  




Now we may compute the product of
:math:`g^{(1)}` and :math:`g^{(2)}`  as follows:

.. math::
   g^{(1)} \cdot g^{(2)}  = g^{(1,n)} \cdot g^{(2,n)}
   = f\big( e^{(1,n)} \cdot e^{(2,n)}, A^{(1,n)}, 
   Q^{(1,n)} \odot    Q^{(2,n)} \big) \; . 
   
If the symmetric :math:`(m+1) \times (m+1)` bit matrices 
:math:`Q^{(\lambda)}, \lambda = 1,2`, represent the quadratic
functions 
:math:`q^{(\lambda)} : \mathbb{F}_2^m \rightarrow\mathbb{T}`,
then we define :math:`Q^{(1)} \odot  Q^{(2)}` as the symmtric
:math:`(m+1) \times (m+1)` bit matrix representing the
quadratic function :math:`q^{(1)} \cdot  q^{(2)}`.
The entries  :math:`Q^{(1 \odot 2)}_{i,j}` of 
:math:`Q^{(1)} \odot  Q^{(2)}` can be computed as follows:

.. math::
    \begin{array}{ll}
    Q^{(1 \odot 2)}_{i,j} = Q^{(1)}_{i,j} + Q^{(2)}_{i,j}
    & \quad \mbox{for} \quad i, j > 0 \; , \\ 
    Q^{(1 \odot 2)}_{i,0} =  Q^{(1 \odot 2)}_{0,i}
    = Q^{(1)}_{0,i} + Q^{(2)}_{0,i} + 
    Q^{(1)}_{i,i} \cdot  Q^{(2)}_{i,i} 
    & \quad \mbox{for} \quad i > 0 \; ,  \\ 
    Q^{(1 \odot 2)}_{0,0} =  0 \; ,
    \end{array}
  
   
   
The corrections in row and column :math:`0` of 
:math:`Q^{(1 \odot 2)}` are necessary, since the diagonal 
entries of :math:`Q^{(1)}`and :math:`Q^{(2)}` are to be 
interpreted modulo :math:`4`.
   
So our algorithm allows us to multiply guadratic mappings 
effectively. 

Remark

In certain cases we have to compute
:math:`\big(e^{(\lambda,j)}, A^{(\lambda,j)}, Q^{(\lambda,j)}\big)`
from
:math:`\big(e^{(\lambda,j-1)}, A^{(\lambda,j-1)}, 
Q^{(\lambda,j-1)}\big)`; and we have the additional information
that e.g. the factor :math:`g_1` of the product :math:`g_1 \cdot g_2`
is a quadratic mapping that does not depend on qubit :math:`i`. 
Then the part :math:`A^{(1,j-1)}` of the representation of 
:math:`g^{(1,j-1)}` always has a row :math:`i` such that
:math:`A^{(1,j-1)}_{i,j}` is the only nonzero entry in
row :math:`i` and in column :math:`j` of   :math:`A^{(1,j-1)}`.
Furthermore, row :math:`i` and column :math:`j` of   
:math:`Q^{(1,j-1)}` are zero in that case.
Thus only cases 1 and 2 can occur in the above computation,
and adding  row :math:`i` of  :math:`A^{(1,j-1)}` to any
other row in that matrix affects column :math:`j` of 
:math:`A^{(1,j-1)}` only, and does not affect :math:`Q^{(1,j-1)}`.
In our implmentation we make use of this simplification
wherever appropriate.


Computing tensor and matrix products
....................................


In this section we explain how to compute the operator 
:math:`(. \odot ,)_{j,c}`. For  :math:`\lambda = 1,2` let
:math:`g^{(\lambda)} : \mathbb{F}_2^{n_\lambda}` be 
quadratic mappings and 
:math:`0 \leq c \leq j \leq \min(n_1, n_2)`.
We first show how to compute a representation of
:math:`(g^{(1)} \odot g^{(2)})_{j}` from the 
representations of :math:`g^{(1)}` and :math:`g^{(2)}`.



For actually computing :math:`(g^{(1)} \odot g^{(2)})_j` we
may extend the mapping 
:math:`g^{(1)}: \mathbb{F}_2^{j} \times \mathbb{F}_2^{n_1-j}
\rightarrow  \mathbb{C}`
to a mapping
:math:`g^{(1')}: \mathbb{F}_2^{j} \times \mathbb{F}_2^{n_1-j}
\times \mathbb{F}_2^{n_2-j} \rightarrow  \mathbb{C}`, with
:math:`g^{(1')}`  not depending on the last factor
:math:`\mathbb{F}_2^{n_2-j}`, as described in one of the
last sections. Similarly, we may extend :math:`g^{(2)}` to
a mapping 
:math:`g^{(2')}: \mathbb{F}_2^{j} \times \mathbb{F}_2^{n_1-j}
\times \mathbb{F}_2^{n_2-j} \rightarrow  \mathbb{C}`, with
:math:`g^{(2')}`  not depending on the factor
:math:`\mathbb{F}_2^{n_2-j}` in the middle.
Then we simply have 
:math:`(g^{(1)} \odot g^{(2)})_j = g^{(1')} \cdot g^{(2')}`.


Using the techniqes discussed in section 
*Extending a quadratic mapping* and in the last section we can
compute a representation of :math:`(g^{(1)} \odot g^{(2)})_j`
from representations of :math:`g^{(1)}` and   :math:`g^{(2)}`.

It remains to compute :math:`(g^{(1)} \odot g^{(2)})_{j,c}` 
from :math:`(g^{(1)} \odot g^{(2)})_{j}`. We have

.. math::
    \big(g^{(1)} \odot g^{(2)}\big)_{j,c}(x) =
    \sum_{y \in  \mathbb{F}_2^c}
    \big(g^{(1)} \odot g^{(2)}\big)_{j}(y, x) \quad
    \mbox{for} \quad x \in  \mathbb{F}_2^{n_1+n_2-j-c} \; .

Let :math:`h : \mathbb{F}_2^n \rightarrow \mathbb{C}` be a
quadratic mapping with representation  :math:`(e, A, Q)`, and
define :math:`h_c : \mathbb{F}_2^{n-c} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}` 
by :math:`x \mapsto \sum_{y \in \mathbb{F}_2^{c}} h(y,x)`.
Then  :math:`h_c` is a quadratic mapping with representation  
:math:`(e, A_c, Q)`, where :math:`A_c` is obtained from 
:math:`A`  by deleting the leftmost :math:`c` columns of
:math:`A`.

So we may easily compute :math:`(g^{(1)} \odot g^{(2)})_{j,c}` 
from :math:`(g^{(1)} \odot g^{(2)})_{j}`.

Restricting a quadratic mapping
...............................



For any function :math:`g: \mathbb{F}_2^{n} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}`
define 
:math:`\hat{g}^{(j)}: \mathbb{F}_2^{n}\rightarrow \mathbb{C}` by
 
.. math::
   \hat{g}^{(j)}(x_{n-1},\ldots, x_j, \ldots, x_0) = 
   \left\{
   \begin{array}{ll}
   g(x_{n-1},\ldots, x_j, \ldots, x_0) & 
   \quad \mbox{if} \quad x_j = 0    \\ 
   0   & \quad \mbox{if} \quad  \mbox  x_j = 1
   \end{array}
   \right.

Then :math:`\hat{g}^{(j)}  = g \cdot \hat{\chi}^{(j)}`, where
:math:`\hat{\chi}^{(j)} :  \mathbb{F}_2^{n} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}`
is a projection function given by 
:math:`(x_{n-1},\ldots, x_j, \ldots, x_0) \mapsto 1 - x_j`.
It is easy to find a representation of the quadratic mapping
:math:`\hat{\chi}^{(j)}` so that we can compute a representation
of  :math:`\hat{g}^{(j)}` from a representation of a quadratic
mapping :math:`g`. This computation is implemented in function
``qstate12_restrict_zero`` in module ``qstate12.c``.


Function :math:`\hat{g}^{(j)}` corresponds to a certain kind of 
a restriction  of the function :math:`g`. Let   :math:`g` be
a quadratic mapping and :math:`(e, A, Q)` be a representation of 
:math:`\hat{g}^{(j)}`. Let 
:math:`V = \mathbb{F}_2^{n-1-j} \times \{0\} \times \mathbb{F}_2^{j}`.
Let :math:`g\mid_V` be the restriction of :math:`g` to :math:`V`.
Then  :math:`(e, A_j, Q)` is a representation of the restriction
:math:`g\mid_V`, where :math:`A_j` is the matrix obtained from
matrix  :math:`A` by deleting column :math:`j`.  Function
``qstate12_restrict`` in module ``qstate12.c`` computes
a representation of :math:`g\mid_V` from a representation of
:math:`g`.

The restriction of a quadratic mapping discussed in this 
section can be used for describing a measurement of a 
stabilizer state on a quantum computer, see e.g. 
:cite:`AG04`.









Quadratic state matrices
........................

A *quadratic state matrix* :math:`S` of shape :math:`(n_0, n_1)` 
is an element of the tensor product :math:`V_0 \otimes V_1` 
with the basis vectors of :math:`V_k` being indexed by 
:math:`\mathbb{F}_2^{n_k}, k = 0, 1`, such that the
coordinate function of :math:`S` is a quadratic mapping.
That coordinate function is a function
:math:`\mathbb{F}_2^{n_0} \times \mathbb{F}_2^{n_1}
\rightarrow \mathbb{C}`.

Thus :math:`S` corresponds to a complex 
:math:`2^{n_0} \times 2^{n_1}` matrix. We may implement
:math:`S` as a quadratic state vector of :math:`n_0 + n_1` 
qubits, augmented by an information about its shape
:math:`(n_0, n_1)` . We let the  :math:`n_0` qubits with
high indices  correspond to the rows of  :math:`S`; and
we let the  :math:`n_1` qubits with low indices  correspond 
to the columns  of  :math:`S`. 

In python we implement a *quadratic state matrix* as a instance of 
class ``QStateMatrix`` in module ``mmgroup.structures.qs_matrix``.
A matrix of shape :math:`(0,n)` corresponds to a row vector of 
dimension :math:`2^{n}` and a matrix of shape :math:`(n,0)` 
corresponds to a column vector of dimension :math:`2^{n}`.
We have seen above that the unitary quadratic state 
matrices of shape :math:`(n,n)` form the Clifford group 
:math:`\mathcal{X}_{n}`. We have also
discussed fast algorithms for multiplication and inversion
of such matrices. So class ``QStateMatrix`` supports fast
computation in Clifford group :math:`\mathcal{X}_{n}`.
Our implementation requires :math:`n \leq 12`, which is
sufficient for computing in the subgroup
:math:`2^{1+24}.\mbox{Co}_1` of the monster group.

Function ``qstate12_matmul`` in file ``qmatrix12.c`` multiplies
two quadratic state matrices.


Reducing a quadratic state matrix
.................................

We define a special *reduced matrix representation* :math:`(e, A, Q)` 
of a quadratic state matrix :math:`S` of shape :math:`(n_0, n_1)` 
that differs slightly from the reduced representation of a 
quadratic state vector. That representation satisfies the 
following conditions:

 1. We require that the representation :math:`(e, A, Q)` is 
    echelonized (but not necessarly reduced), as described in 
    section
    *Reducing the representation of a quadratic mapping*.
    
 2. Let :math:`A'` be the bit matrix obtained from :math:`A` by
    removing the leftmost :math:`n_0` columns from  :math:`A`.
    We require that  a permutation of the rows of matrix
    :math:`A'`, excluding row :math:`0`, is in (not necessarily 
    reduced) echelon form.
    
    Note that the first :math:`n_0` columns of the bit matrix
    :math:`A` correspond to the :math:`2^{n_0}` columns of 
    the complex matrix :math:`S`; and the remaining  
    :math:`n_1` columns of :math:`A` correspond to the
    :math:`2^{n_1}` rows of :math:`S`.
        
 3. Let :math:`K_0` be the set of the rows of the bit matrix 
    :math:`A` such that all bits in the leftmost :math:`n_0` 
    columns of that row are zero. Let :math:`K_1` be the set of 
    the  rows of :math:`A` such that all bits in rightmost
    :math:`n_1` columns of that row are zero. We exclude row 
    :math:`0` from :math:`K_0` and from :math:`K_1`. 
    
    If the bit matrix :math:`A` has :math:`m'` rows then
    the bit matrix :math:`Q` is a symmetric 
    :math:`m' \times m'` bit matrix. Let :math:`Q'` be the 
    submatrix of :math:`Q` that consists of all rows with
    index in :math:`K_1` and of all columns with index in
    :math:`K_0` .

    We require that submatrix :math:`Q'` of :math:`Q`  has at 
    most one nonzero entry in each row and in each column. 

    Note that  :math:`K_0 \cap K_1 = \emptyset`, since the
    representation :math:`(e, A, Q)` is echelonized.

We may obtain a *reduced matrix representation* :math:`(e, A, Q)` 
of a quadratic state matrix :math:`S` of shape :math:`(n_0, n_1)` 
as follows:

  * Starting from a reduced representation :math:`(e_0, A_0, Q_0)` 
    of a quadratic state vector :math:`S` we may obtain a 
    representation :math:`(e_1, A_1, Q_1)` of the matrix  :math:`S` 
    satifying condition *(2.)* by applying a seqence of  
    transformations :math:`T_{i,j}, i < j`. Then 
    :math:`A_1` is also in echelon form. :math:`T_{i,j}` 
    is defined in section *Implementation of quadratic mappings*. 

  * We apply a sequence of transformations :math:`T_{i,j}, i < j`,
    with :math:`i, j \in K_0` or :math:`i, j \in K_1` to 
    :math:`(e_1, A_1, Q_1)`. These transformations preserve the 
    echelon form of :math:`A_1` and also property *(2.)*. Since 
    :math:`K_0 \cap K_1 = \emptyset`, these transformations act as
    row and column operations on the submatrix :math:`S'`
    of  :math:`S`. So we may achieve property *(3.)* by a sequence
    of such transformations, thus obtaining a suitable
    representation :math:`(e, A, Q)` of  :math:`S`.



Using a *reduced matrix representation* :math:`(e, A, Q)` of a
quadratic state matrix :math:`S` has a variety of advantages.

 * We can easily compute the rank of :math:`S` as follows:

   For :math:`(e, A, Q)` let :math:`K_0, K_1, Q'` be defined as 
   above. Let  :math:`K_2` be the subset :math:`K_1` containing 
   alls rows of :math:`A` such that the corrsponding row of 
   bit matrix  :math:`Q'` is zero. Then the binary logarithm of
   the rank of :math:`S` is equal to the number of rows of
   matrix :math:`A` with are neither in  :math:`K_0` nor in 
   :math:`K_2`. Here we have to exclude row :math:`0` of :math:`A`.  

   We omit the proof of this fact since we do not need it
   for our purposes.

 * That representation can be used for decomposing :math:`S`
   into a product :math:`M_1 \cdot H \cdot M_2` of quadratic 
   state matrices, where :math:`M_1, M_2` are monomial and 
   :math:`H` is a Hadamard-like matrix. By a Hadamard-like
   matrix we mean a matrix obtained from the unit matrix by
   applying Hadamard gates to the row vectors.

   If :math:`S` has shape :math:`(n,n)` then such a decomposition
   reduces the complexity of multiplying :math:`S` with an
   arbitrary complex vector form :math:`O(4^n)` to
   :math:`O(n \cdot 2^n)`.

   Essentially, we have used such a decomposition for 
   multiplying the non-monimial part of generator :math:`\xi` 
   of the monster :math:`\mathbb{M}` with a vector of our 
   representation of :math:`\mathbb{M}`. Since this special
   case is discussed elsewhere, we do not go into details here.

 * In the next section we will introduce the Pauli group 
   :math:`\mathcal{P}_{n}`, which is an important normal 
   subgroup of :math:`\mathcal{X}_{n}`. Using the reduced 
   matrix representation of an element :math:`S` of 
   :math:`\mathcal{X}_{n}` we can conugate any element
   of :math:`\mathcal{P}_{n}` with :math:`S` in  
   :math:`O(n^2)` bit operations.
   
   With quadratic state matrices, a general matrix 
   multiplication in the Clifford group :math:`\mathcal{X}_{n}` 
   costs :math:`O(n^3)` bit operations.

   

Function ``qstate12_reduce_matrix`` in file ``qmatrix12.c``
converts any representation of a quadratic state matrix to a
reduced matrix representation.

The Pauli group
...............

The *Pauli group* :math:`\mathcal{P}_{n}` of :math:`n` qubits
is the normal subgroup of the Clifford group 
:math:`\mathcal{X}_{n}` generated by the not gates, the phase 
:math:`\pi` gates in :math:`\mathcal{X}_{n}`, and by the scalar 
multiples of the unit matrix by a fourth root of unity. It has 
structure :math:`\frac{1}{2}(2_+^{1+2n} \times Z_4)`, exponent
math:`4` and order :math:`2^{2n+2}`.
 
We represent an element of :math:`\mathcal{P}_{n}` as a product
of :math:`2n+2` generators. Each generator may have exponent 
:math:`0` or :math:`1`. The sequence of these exponents are   
stored as a bit vector as follows:

  * Bit :math:`2n+1` corresponds to multiplication with 
    the scalar :math:`\sqrt{-1}`.

  * Bit :math:`2n` corresponds to  multiplication with
    the scalar :math:`-1`.

  * Bit :math:`n+i` with :math:`0 \leq i < n` corresponds to 
    a not gate applied to qubit :math:`i`.

  * Bit :math:`i` with :math:`0 \leq i < n` corresponds to 
    a phase :math:`\pi` gate applied to qubit :math:`i`.


Factors are ordered by bit positions, with the most significant 
bit position occuring first. In the C language we represent bit 
vectors a integers as usual.

All generators commute and have order :math:`2` except for the
following cases:

  * A phase :math:`\pi` gate anticommutes with a not gate
    applied to the same qubit, i.e their commutator is the
    scalar  :math:`-1`.

  * Of course, the scalar :math:`\sqrt{-1}`
    squares to the scalar :math:`-1`.


Functions ``qstate12_pauli_vector_mul`` and 
``qstate12_pauli_vector_exp`` in module ``qs_matrix.c`` 
perform multiplication and exponentiation in the Pauli group
:math:`\mathcal{P}_{n}`.


Given an element :math:`p` of the Pauli group and a
*reduced matrix representation* :math:`(e, A, Q)` of a
unitary quadratic state matrix :math:`S`, we can quickly 
compute the conjugate  :math:`S^{-1} \cdot p \cdot S` as 
follows:

  * Left multiply :math:`S` with :math:`p` by applying the 
    appropriate gates to :math:`S`. This affects row 
    :math:`0` of the bit matrix :math:`A` and  row and 
    column :math:`0` of the symmetic bit  matrix :math:`Q` 
    only.

  * Restore the original values  :math:`A[0,j]` or all
    :math:`j \geq n` and the original values 
    :math:`Q[0,k] = Q[k,0]` for all :math:`k > n` by applying 
    appropriate transformations :math:`T_{0,j}` to the 
    modified representation :math:`(e, A, Q)`. 
    This does not change the value :math:`p \cdot S` of 
    the complex matrix computed in the previous step.
    :math:`T_{0,j}` is defined in section
    *Implementation of quadratic mappings*.

  * We may restore the the remaining original values of row 
    and column :math:`0` of :math:`Q` by applying phase 
    :math:`\pi` gates to :math:`S`. These gate operations 
    correspond to a right multiplication with a element 
    :math:`p_1` of the Pauli group.

  * We may restore the the remaining original values of row 
    :math:`0` of :math:`A` by applying not gates to
    :math:`S`. These gate operations correspond to a right
    multiplication with a element :math:`p_2` of the Pauli
    group.

  * Up to a known scalar factor we have obtained an equation
    :math:`S = p  \cdot S \cdot p_2 \cdot p_1`, with 
    :math:`p_1, p_2` in the  Pauli group. With this equation
    the requested conjugation is an easy computation in the 
    Pauli group.

Function ``qstate12_pauli_conjugate`` in module 
``qs_matrix.c`` performs this conjugation.




Applying a (controlled) not gate to a quadratic mapping
.......................................................

In the theory of quantum computing we may apply so-called
*gates* to a quadratic state vector in 
:math:`(\mathbb{C}^2)^{\otimes n}`. For our puposes a gate
is a linear operation on  
:math:`(\mathbb{C}^2)^{\otimes n} = (\mathbb{C}^2)^{\otimes k}
\otimes  (\mathbb{C}^2)^{\otimes n-k}`
which may be written as a tensor product of a unitary
:math:`2^k \times 2^k` matrix `G` and a
:math:`2^{n-k} \times 2^{n-k}` identitiy matrix for a small
number :math:`1 \leq k \leq 2`. Here we may permute the factors
:math:`\mathbb{C}^2` of :math:`(\mathbb{C}^2)^{\otimes n}` 
arbitrarily before the decompostion into a tensor product as 
above.

A *not* gate operating in qubit :math:`j` maps a  state 
:math:`g` to a state :math:`g'` with
:math:`g'(x) = g(x + e_j)`, where
:math:`e_j = (0,\ldots,0,1,0,\ldots,0)` and  the component
:math:`1` is at position `j`. 
A *not* gate operating in qubit :math:`j` is implemented
for :math:`g = f(e,A,Q)` by flipping the bit :math:`A_{0,j}`.
The C function ``state12_gate_not`` implements a sequence of 
not gates.

A *controlled not* gate is a gate that negates a target qubit
:math:`j \neq j` controlled by a qubit :math:`j'`. Such a 
gate maps a state :math:`g` to a state :math:`g'` with
:math:`g'(x) = g(x + \langle e_{j'},x \rangle \cdot e_j)`,
where :math:`\langle .,. \rangle` is the scalar product 
of bit vectors. Such a gate is implemented for 
:math:`g = f(e,A,Q)` by adding column :math:`j'` of 
:math:`A` to  column :math:`j` of :math:`A`. The C function 
``state12_gate_ctrl_not`` implements a generalization of a
controlled not gate.


In the following two sections we discuss more types of gates.
Altogether, these gates generate the Clifford group 
:math:`\mathcal{X}_n` on :math:`n` qubits.

Applying a (controlled) phase gate to a quadratic mapping
.........................................................


Applying a phase :math:`\phi` gate  to qubit :math:`j` of
a state :math:`g= f(e,A,Q)` changes the state :math:`g` to 
a state :math:`g'` with 

.. math::
    g'(x_0,\ldots,x_j,\ldots,x_{n-1}) =
    \exp(\phi  x_j \sqrt{-1}) \cdot
    g(x_0,\ldots,x_j,\ldots,x_{n-1}) \; .
    
We consider only phase :math:`\phi` which are multiples of
:math:`\pi/2`. For an :math:`(m+1) \times n` matrix 
:math:`A` let :math:`A_j` be the :math:`j`-th column of
matrix :math:`A`. Let  :math:`A_{-1}` be the column vector 
:math:`(1,0,\ldots,0)^\top` with :math:`m+1` entries.
Then a phase :math:`\pi` gate on qubit :math:`j` maps
:math:`f(e,A,Q)` to 

.. math::
    f\left( (-1)^{A_{0,j}} \cdot e, A, Q \odot A_{-1} A_j ^\top
    \odot    A_j A_{-1}^\top \right) \; .
    
Here we consider :math:`A_j, A_{-1}` as a :math:`(m+1) \times 1`
matrices, so that the matrix product :math:`A_j A_{-1}^\top` 
is an :math:`(m+1) \times (m+1)` matrix. Operator :math:`\odot`
is as in section *Multiplication of quadratic mappings*.

A phase :math:`\pi/2` gate on qubit :math:`j` maps
:math:`f(e,A,Q)` to 
 
.. math::
    f\left( \sqrt{-1}^{A_{0,j}} \cdot e, A, Q \odot A_j A_j ^\top
    \right) \; .


Applying a controlled phase :math:`\pi` gate  to qubits
:math:`j` and :math:`j'` of a state :math:`g= f(e,A,Q)` changes 
the state :math:`g` to  a state :math:`g'` with 

.. math::
    g'(\ldots,x_j,\ldots,x_{j'},\ldots ) =
    (-1)^{x_j x_{j'}} \cdot
    g(\ldots,x_j,\ldots,x_{j'},\ldots) \; .
    
    
A conrtolled phase :math:`\pi` gate on qubit :math:`j` and
:math:`j'` maps  :math:`f(e,A,Q)` to     


.. math::
    f\left( (-1)^{A_{0,j} \cdot A_{0,j'}} \cdot e, A, 
    Q \odot A_j A_{j'}^\top \odot A_{j'} A_j^\top  \right) \; .


We leave the proofs of these statements to the reader.

Applying a Hadamard gate to a quadratic mapping
...............................................

A Hadamard gate at qubit :math:`j` is a a mapping that changes
a quadratic mapping :math:`g` to another quadratic mapping 
:math:`1/\sqrt{2} \cdot g'` with

.. math::
    g'(x_0,\ldots,x_{j-1},x_j,x_{j+1},\ldots,x_{n-1}) =
    g(x_0,\ldots,x_{j-1},0,x_{j+1},\ldots,x_{n-1}) + (-1)^{x_j} \cdot 
    g(x_0,\ldots,x_{j-1},1,x_{j+1},\ldots,x_{n-1}) \; .
    
    
We implement the application of a Hadamard gate on qubit :math:`j`
to a quadatic mapping :math:`g` represented as :math:`(e, A, Q)` 
as follows.

We append a zero row at :math:`A` and also a zero row and a
zero column at :math:`Q`. Let :math:`i` be the index of the 
appended row and column. Then we put 
:math:`Q_{i,k} = Q_{k,i} = A_{k,j}`, :math:`A_{k,j} = 0`
for all :math:`k \neq i`, and  :math:`A_{i,j} = 1`. Let 
:math:`A', Q'` be the modified matrices :math:`A', Q'`. 
Then :math:`g' = f(e, A', Q')`.

The correctenss of this algorithm can be seen as follows.
W.l.o.g we assume that :math:`j` is the last index :math:`n-1`.
Let :math:`x = (x_0,\ldots, x_j) \in \mathbb{F}_2^n`,
:math:`y  = (y_0,\ldots, y_m) \in   \mathbb{F}_2^{m+1}`
with :math:`y_0 = 1`,  and assume :math:`y \cdot A = x`
for the matrix product :math:`y \cdot A`. 
Then 

.. math::
   (y, b) \cdot A' = (x_0,\ldots,x_{n-1},b) \quad 
   \mbox{for} \quad b \in \mathbb{F}_2 \; .

Let :math:`q, q'` be the quadratic mappings given by :math:`Q, Q'`.
Then 

.. math::
    q'(y, b) = (-1)^{b \cdot \langle y, A_j \rangle} \cdot q(y)
    = (-1)^{b \cdot x_j} \cdot q(y) \; ,
    
where :math:`A_j` is the :math:`j`-th column of :math:`A`. 
Thus

.. math::
   f(e, A',Q')(x_0, \ldots, x_{j-1}, x_j) =
   g(x_0, \ldots, x_{j-1}, 0) + 
   (-1)^{x_j} \cdot g(x_0, \ldots, x_{j-1}, 1) \; .


The C function ``state12_gate_h`` implements a sequence of 
Hadamard gates.


C functions dealing with quadratic state vectors
................................................


The C functions in modules ``qstate.c`` and ``qsmatrix.c``
perform operations on quadratic state matrices given by triples 
:math:`(e, A, Q)` as defined above. Here component :math:`e` 
encodes the number  :math:`\exp(e \pi \sqrt{-1} / 4) \cdot 
2^{\lfloor e/16 \rfloor / 2}`, and
:math:`A` is an  :math:`(1+m) \times n` bit matrix.
:math:`Q` is a symmetric :math:`(1+m) \times (1+m)` bit matrix 
representing an symmetric bilinear form. We always have
:math:`Q_{0,0}=0`. Put :math:`m'=1+m`. Matrices :math:`A` and 
:math:`Q` are concatenated to an :math:`m' \times (n+m')` matrix
:math:`M` with :math:`M_{i,j} = A_{i,j}` for :math:`j < n` and
:math:`M_{i,j} = Q_{i-n,j}` for :math:`j \geq n`. Matrix
:math:`M` is encoded in a one-dimensional array of unsigned
64-bit integers. Here bit :math:`j` of entry :math:`i` 
corresponds to :math:`M_{i,j}`, with bit :math:`0` the least
significant bit.

A quadratic state matrix is described by a structure containing 
the following components:

.. code-block:: c

  typedef struct {
    uint32_t maxrows; // No of entries allocated to component data
    uint32_t nrows;   // No m' = m + 1 of rows of bit matrix A
    uint32_t ncols;   // No n of columns of bit matrices A and Q
    int32_t  factor;  // A number e encoding a scaling factor
    uint64_t *data;   // Pointer to the data bits of matrix M
    uint32_t shape1;  // Describes the shape of the quadratic state
                      // matrix, as indicated below.
  } qbstate12_type;

A quadratic state vector :math:`v` of type
``qbstate12_type`` with component ``ncols = n`` models a complex 
vector in a vector space  :math:`V` of dimension :math:`2^n`, and 
that the basis of ``V`` is labelled by the elements of the Boolean
vector space :math:`\mathbb{F}_2^n`. In C and python programs
we represent the element :math:`(x_{n-1}, \ldots, x_{0})` of
:math:`\mathbb{F}_2^n` by the integer 
:math:`\sum_{0 \leq i < n} 2^i \cdot x_i`. This leads to a natural
representation of ``v`` as a one-dimensional complex array of
length :math:`2^n`, starting with index ``0``.

A quadratic state matrix is a quadratic shape vector augmented
by an information about its matrix shape. For a quadratic state
matrix ``qs`` of shape ``(n0, n1)`` we put ``qs.ncols = n0 + n1``
and ``qs.ncols = n1``.

The zero state is encoded as a matrix with :math:`m'=0` rows.
We do not update the entries :math:`Q_{i,0}`, so the 
corresponding bits in compoment ``data`` of the structure
are garbage. One may use the C function ``qstate12_check`` to
set these bits to their proper values.


The current implementation requires ``n + m <= 63``.  
This can easily be generalized to larger Clifford 
groups by reserving an array of several integers for each row 
of matrix :math:`M`. Here we also leave the details to the reader.

C functions supporting this module are prefixed with ``qbstate12_``.
Unless otherwise stated, these functions return an ``int32_t``, 
where a nonegative value is interpreted as success, and a negative 
value is intepreted as failure. Depending on the function, a 
nonnegative return value may e.g. mean an index for a matrix
:math:`A`, :math:`M`, or :math:`Q`.

Typical names for parameters of functions in this module are:

   ``pqs, pqs1, ...`` Pointer to structure of type ``qbstate12_type``
   ``nqb``            Number of qubits, i.e. of columns of matrix 
                      :math:`A`.
   ``nrows``          Number of rows of matrix :math:`A`, :math:`M`, 
                      and :math:`Q`.

                      starting with ``j = 0``.
                      If appropriate, an index  ``j >= ncols`` refers 
                      to column ``(j - ncols)`` of matrix  :math:`Q`.
   ``pv, pv1,...``    Pointer to a row or column vector of matrix 
                      :math:`A`, :math:`M`, or  :math:`Q`.
